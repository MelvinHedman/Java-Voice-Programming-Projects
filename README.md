# Java Voice Programming Projects
This repository contains blueprints for the thesis: Java Programming By Voice. The blueprints 
are meant to be replicated by using our adaptation and the standard version
of the voice programming tool Serenade. This repository will also include the replications. To verify the replications, 
generated test cases will be used.
